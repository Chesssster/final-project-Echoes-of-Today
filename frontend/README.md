# Week 11: Frontend Development
</div>

In Week 11, we focused on building the frontend structure of our website Echoes of Today. This marked the transition from planning and design to actual implementation. We started designing the user interface by creating several key pages.

## Frontend Pages Created and Their Functionalities

### 🔑 Authentication Page

This page provides forms for user login and registration.

### 🏠 Home Page

The Home Page displays the list of the users written journals.

### ℹ️ Write Page

In this page the user will write his/her thoughts and ideas. The user can also attach an image to his written journal.

### 🛍️ Community Page

In this page, it will display the list of communities that the user can join. The user can also create a community and set rules in his community.

## Alignment with Use Case Diagram and ERD
</div>

Each page developed this week directly reflects key parts of our Use Case Diagram and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).

### 🔑 Authentication Page

* Linked to the User entity in the ERD
* Handles account creation and login for users

### 🏠 Write Page

* In this page, the user can write a journal.

### 🛍️ Community Page

* Reflects the Create Community and Join Community.
*The user can create or join a community in this page.


## 📝 Summary

This week’s improvements focused on turning the backend structure into a working user interface. The frontend pages are carefully matched with the Use Case Diagram and ERD, ensuring that what users see matches how data is handled behind the scenes. This lays the groundwork for adding backend capabilities in the coming week. However, there are still certain details that must be updated and adjusted in the coming week to improve the system's design and functioning.
